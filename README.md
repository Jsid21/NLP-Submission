# Natural Language Processing Assignment Repository

This repository contains solutions to various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks implemented using Python. Below are the assignments with brief explanations and the corresponding techniques used for each task.

## Assignments

### 1. **Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization**
   - **Task:** Implement different tokenization methods (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE) using the NLTK library.
   - **Stemming:** Applied Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer.
   - **Lemmatization:** Used a suitable technique for lemmatization.
   - **Library Used:** `nltk`

### 2. **Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings**
   - **Task:** Implement Bag-of-Words approach (count occurrence, normalized occurrence), and TF-IDF on text data.
   - **Embeddings:** Created word embeddings using Word2Vec.
   - **Library Used:** `nltk`, `gensim`

### 3. **Text Preprocessing and Encoding**
   - **Task:** Perform text cleaning, lemmatization, stop word removal, and label encoding.
   - **Representations:** Created TF-IDF representations and saved the processed outputs.
   - **Library Used:** `nltk`, `sklearn`

### 4. **Transformer from Scratch**
   - **Task:** Built a Transformer model architecture from scratch using the PyTorch library.
   - **Library Used:** `pytorch`

### 5. **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Task:** Implemented a more advanced sentiment analysis model using a pre-trained transformer-based model.
   - **Library Used:** `transformers`, `torch`, `HuggingFace`

### 6. **N-Gram Model for Auto-Completion**
   - **Task:** Developed an auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram model.
   - **Applications:** The model is useful for tasks such as text translation, author identification, and speech recognition.
   - **Library Used:** `nltk`, `sklearn`
